Today my presentation topic is the PARA method

what is it?
it is a universal system for organizing digital information.

we always get so many information from many channels, and sometimes we don't know how to deal with it. and this system will help us

let's start with definitions.

P: Projects
A: Areas
R: Resources
A: Archives

a project is "a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline", 

examples include: execute business development campaign; write blog post; attend conference

an area of responsibility is "a sophere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time"

examples include: health;finance; travel;hobbies;friends

a resource is "a topic or theme of ongoing interest"

examples include:habit formation; project management; music;online marketing; SEO

Archives include"inactive items from the other three categories"

examples include: projects that have been completed or become inactive; areas that you are no longer committed to maintaining; resource that you are no longer interested in

Projects always fall into Areas, in other word, Projects to Areas as  publishing a book to Writing

and Projects always have completion dates, whereas Areas of responsibility have standard of performance that must be maintained indefinitely.

how do we organizing digital information with this system?
firstly, define your projects, or they will define you
secondly, set up your projects list and make them linked to your areas
then, say goodbye to your past, you can move all your files to Archieves. 

today i only introduced a part of it, if you are interested in it, we can talk more and learn it deeper together.
